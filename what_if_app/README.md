# Summary
This demand forecasting what-if app allows users to adjust certain known in advance (KA) variable values to see how changes in those factors might affect the forecasted demand.

Some examples of factors that might be adjusted include marketing promotions, pricing, seasonality, or competitor activity. By using the app to explore different scenarios and adjust KA inputs, users can make more accurate predictions about future demand and plan accordingly.

# How to run:
- install the packages according to the configuration file `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- update the `config/config.toml` file with:
    - `API_KEY`: In DataRobot, navigate to **Developer Tools** by clicking on the user icon in the top-right corner. From here you can generate a API Key that you will use to authenticate to DataRobot. You can find more details on creating an API key [in the DataRobot documentation](https://app.datarobot.com/docs/api/api-quickstart/index.html#create-a-datarobot-api-key). 
    - `ENDPOINT`: Determine your DataRobot API Endpoint. The API endpoint is the same as your DataRobot UI root. Replace {datarobot.example.com} with your deployment endpoint. API endpoint root: `https://{datarobot.example.com}/api/v2`. For users of the AI Cloud platform, the endpoint is `https://app.datarobot.com/api/v2`
    - `DATE_COL`: The datetime partition column defined before the project creation.
    - `SERIES_ID`: The multiseries id column defined before the project creation.
    - `TARGET`: The target column defined before the project creation.
    - `KA_COLS`: A list of KA features
    - `DEPLOYMENT_ID`: The deployment id to use for making predictions. It can be created with [the previous accelerator](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/tree/main/end-to-end/End_to_end_demand_forecasting). If you used the above accelerator to generate the deployment id, you can use [this prediction file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/datarobot_public_datasets/ai_accelerators/ts_demand_forecasting_scoring.csv) to test the app.
- run the app with the command: `streamlit run demand_forecasting_app.py`
- the Streamlit app should be available in your browser: http://localhost:8501

# How to use:
1. Upload the scoring dataset
2. Update KA features or use the uploaded data as is
3. Run predictions
4. Plot results: total, per group or individual series
5. Download predictions per scenario or all runs together
